## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of cybersecurity projects that cover a range of topics, tools, and techniques. These projects are intended for educational and learning purposes, as well as to demonstrate practical applications of cybersecurity concepts.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects currently included in this repository:

### 1. [Project 1: Port Scanner](/port_scanner)
   #### Description: <br/>
   <ul>
   <li>The project is a basic Python-based port scanner tool. It allows users to input a target host IP address along with a range of port numbers to be scanned. The tool then checks each port within the specified range to determine if it is open or closed on the target host. </li> <br/>
<li>The port scanner provides a quick and straightforward way to identify open ports, which can be valuable for network administrators and security enthusiasts to assess the security posture of a system or network. Users can easily run the scanner and receive immediate feedback on the status of the specified ports.</li> <br/>

<li>Please note that while this project serves as an introductory exploration of port scanning, conducting such activities on networks and systems without proper authorization may violate ethical guidelines and applicable laws. Responsible use of this tool is essential to ensure the security and privacy of network assets.</li> <br/>
</ul>
